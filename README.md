The Basic Calculator App is a simple yet functional desktop application developed using Python's Tkinter library. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app combines the power of Python's eval() function for dynamic expression evaluation and user-defined functions for custom operations and validation.

Features:
Intuitive GUI:

A clean and interactive interface built with Tkinter.
Numeric buttons (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /) arranged in a grid layout.
A clear display area to input and view mathematical expressions.
Arithmetic Operations:

Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Handles multi-step calculations with parentheses and operator precedence.
Custom Functionality:

User-defined functions for additional validation and error handling.
Prevents invalid inputs like multiple operators in sequence.
Displays error messages for invalid mathematical expressions (e.g., division by zero).
Dynamic Expression Evaluation:

Leverages Python's eval() function for efficient evaluation of user-entered expressions.
Reset and Clear Functionality:

A "C" button to clear the display for fresh calculations.
Seamless handling of new calculations without restarting the application.

Technologies Used:
Language: Python
Libraries:
Tkinter: For GUI development.
Eval(): For dynamic expression parsing and calculation.
